# Arduino_Mega_drone

The quadcopter I designed uses an Arduino Mega microcontroller board as the flight controller, with a L3G4200D 3-axis gyroscope sensor breakout for balancing the drone. Coding was primarily done using Arduino & embedded C++. Interrupts were used to provide manual control using a 2.4Ghz/5Ghz transmitter-receiver combo.
